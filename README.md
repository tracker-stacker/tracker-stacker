# tracker-stacker

Define & track agile projects.

This repo currently contains a summary of search for existing solution; next steps are to consider whether to develop a webapp to meet some/all of the critical needs.

Desired benefit: An integrated solution that covers all critical aspects of defining & tracking requirements. Most promising proposal so far is to use 'glue code' & apis to combine existing services & fill the existing gaps between them. Ultimately we hope for a tool that allows all stakeholders in a given agile project to collaborate extensively.

## summary of preliminary findings

To date ... Through the testing of multiple time-tracking[note_f] solutions, frustrations continually surfaced as none seemed to fully meet the business requirements of agile practices. Shortcomings were regularly discovered, & stop-gap measures were implemented to continue effectively using the platforms. In order to get a clearly-defined sense of ongoing business operations, the integration of multiple solutions was required. With each aditional implementation, the fragility of the integration rose. Eventually, more effort was spent on bridging the gaps rather than using the software to gain valuable insights.

## breakout of key requirements

This list currently serves as a ['straw man proposal'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man_proposal) ("a brainstormed simple draft proposal intended to generate discussion of its disadvantages and to provoke the generation of new and better proposals.")

### Define project scope collaboratively, present it for input & manage changes
collect initial input from stakeholders using templates; make best practices easy to follow for people who are not web professionals
- list of stakeholders
  - project owners
  - design team
  - implementation team
  - testing team
  - editorial team
  - documentation team
  - maintenance team
  - infrastructure team
  - other (authenticated) consumers of selected pieces of information

### Define & track budget use & manage changes
- include budget tracked on various platforms
- understand budget specifics at a glance, especially
  - overall budget vs percent of work complete vs budget spent
  - line-item budget allocated vs progress on tasks vs budget spent

### Define & track tasks
  - prioritize/reallocate efforts
  - vendor effort & time management
- project tracking needs
  - overview of project progress against budget
  - line items completed & in progress
  - status of unfininshed line items
  - % spent on project, % invoiced to client, % collecsted
  - description of completed efforts
- ability to export costs into clinet-ready invoice

[note_f] would 'supply chain management' be a more accurate term for the total effort? Is there an even more generic-yet-accurate term?

objective: this piece is intended eventually to help other firms decide whether their needs match those of the group & whether they'd want to get the benefits of joining the development team

style: give yourself credit for your efforts to date vs using passive constructions
