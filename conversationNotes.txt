Exploratory conversations - recorded or taking collaborative notes after the fact. 
If I have "x" amount of time available on "x day" that can help me schedule to work on "x" amount of time for the following week. 

"Scripts"
Kay ptu more eloquently - if you can spend x amount of time setting me up with y and z, I can devote _n_ hours to these topics

Scenario 2: ve run into a problem with x; can you help me get unstuck

[thax] process (supply chain) breakout (so we can dig into details of what processes need improvement)

'story' as a vendor, I can import hours spent on specific tasks into Freshbooks - need user story in onsof

'standup' --discussion
process for booking time to keep tasks moving forward

notes from 7/6/2016

broadly
[tc] sharing billing (clients & onso PM)
- create GAA project in Freshbooks
 -- [kv] send TC ownsourcing email
 -- starting up a new ownsourcing Freshbooks account (use ownsourcing email)
 -- send KV invite
 -- [kv] add payment info to account
 -- add major steps as user stories in Jira & as line items
- 
[tc] sharing dev plans & line items (external/internal devs)
IMPORTANT: without analysis, moving quickly and knowing things are not perfect
-  identify all steps in client-supplied documents
- 

project reporting: each effort contains the following information in Jira, Freshbooks, client invoice and line items shared with vendors
epic/major focus: e.g. Q.Admin
task/user story/line item: e.g. Q.Admin slideshow (advance through submissions during admin)
subtasks (no line items; add time & date; use comments to describe effort; refer to Jira ticket number & name)

data tools
atom
text wrangler - appears to only be for Mac users.
notepad (notepad ++)
grep
