**summary of findings**

Through the testing of multiple time-tracking solutions, frustrations continually surfaced as none seemed to fully meet the business requirements of agile practices. Shortcomings were regularly discovered, and stop-gap measures were implemented to continue effectively using the platforms. In order to get a clearly-defined sense of ongoing business operations, the integration of multiple solutions was required. With each aditional implementation, the fragility of the integration rose. Eventually, more effort was spent on bridging the gaps rather than using the software to gain valuable insights.
